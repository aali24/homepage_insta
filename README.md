# homepage_insta
My first CSS project in creating an Insta homepage


The insta_home.html file was divided into div tags and created class attributes using CSS on the styles.css file. After linking my CSS file to my HTML file, I started to look for style attributes to make my Instagram homepage. The first style I looked for was a form tag for my HTML file to mimic a sign up section for my homepage. 

My next task was to border my form section with good looking border styles. I added a border radius, border color and border height to my CSS that would blend nicely into my homepage. 

My difficulty during this was finding the correct syntax for my border attributes and then making sure my sign up section was layed under the align section of my HTML file. Another problem I faced was making sure my align section was placed vertically in the middle whilst ot floated to the right. I overcame many of these problems by changing the margin aronud my align section.

I also needed to make sure that my footer stayed fixed to the bottom of my homepage and eventually did this by placing an id tag for my footer section and using CSS to make sure this id had a fixed position.

All in all, the homepage produced had the basic layout and was a good attempt for my first use of CSS. With some more time, I would improve my homepage by adding more functionalities for the sign up section, blend the right type of colors for all my images and add a few more sections to sign up using different links.
